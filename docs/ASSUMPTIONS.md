# Trust base & assumptions

A proof is only meaningful relative to what it assumes. This file is the honest ledger.
**Update it the moment any assumption is introduced.** Reviewers will read this first.

## Standing assumptions
- **Compiler correctness.** We verify C (via its LLVM bitcode) and the FIPS spec; we assume the
  compiler faithfully lowers verified C. (Same assumption Apple states for corecrypto.)
- **Tool soundness.** We trust SAW, Cryptol, the cryptol-to-isabelle translator, and Isabelle.
- **Spec faithfulness.** We assume our Isabelle formalization of FIPS 204 (or the reused Apple
  formalization) faithfully captures the standard. Provenance noted in spec/README.md.

## Scope limits (v1)
- Only the forward NTT and its modular-reduction primitives.
- Input ranges actually checked: <FILL IN — e.g. coefficients in the canonical range>.
- Anything not listed as proven is, explicitly, NOT proven.

## Tool/version pins
Pinned and installed by `scripts/setup.sh` into `.tools/` (gitignored). Platform of record:
**macOS 26.3.1, Apple Silicon (arm64)**, set up 2026-06-01.

- SAW: **v1.5.1** (2026-05-22), asset `saw-1.5.1-macos-15-ARM64-with-solvers.tar.gz`.
- Cryptol: **3.5.0** (git 6173b60), bundled inside the SAW 1.5.1 tarball (used in-place to avoid skew).
- cryptol-to-isabelle: bundled standalone in the SAW 1.5.1 tarball (first release to ship it).
- Isabelle: **Isabelle2025-2** (Jan 2026), asset `Isabelle2025-2_macos.tar.gz` (universal bundle,
  upstream lists macOS 26 / Apple Silicon support).
- clang: **Apple clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.5)**, system `/usr/bin/clang` (NOT vendored — see below).
- z3: 4.15.4 present on system, but the SAW "with-solvers" bundle ships its own solver set; the
  pipeline prefers the bundled solvers for reproducibility.

### Platform / toolchain caveats (introduced 2026-06-01)
- **SAW binary built for macOS 15, run on macOS 26.** No arm64 macOS-26-specific SAW build exists
  upstream; the macOS-15 arm64 build is what we run. Flagged here for honesty; gated on `saw --version`
  actually running before we depend on it.
- **Apple Silicon Gatekeeper.** On macOS arm64 a downloaded binary that is only ad-hoc signed and
  still carries the `com.apple.quarantine` xattr is SIGKILLed on exec ("Killed: 9"). `setup.sh`
  strips quarantine (`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`) and ad-hoc re-signs the Mach-O binaries
  (`codesign --force --sign -`). Neither alters behavior; they only satisfy the loader. Verified:
  `saw --version` → `1.5.1`, `cryptol --version` → `3.5.0` after this step.
- **Apple clang, not mainline LLVM/clang.** We emit LLVM bitcode for SAW with the system Apple clang
  (17.0.0). Apple's clang can emit a bitcode/IR version that differs from mainline; if SAW's LLVM
  parser rejects it, the documented fallback is a pinned mainline `clang`. Part of the trust base
  (see "Compiler correctness").
